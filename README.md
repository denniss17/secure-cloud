# SecureCloud

Protect your precious files in the cloud. SecureCloud employs end-to-end encryption, while still giving you the
opportunity to share your files with other users. All this time, you are the boss! 
You manage the file access and you only have the keys. The keys are not stored in cloud.

## FAQ

### What is encryption?

With encryption, your data is protected from outsiders by transforming the data using a mathematical calculation.
After this transformation, your data seems to be random. Only with the correct key, the calculation can be reverted.

### What is end-to-end encryption?

End-to-end encryption means that the data is encrypted at the sender, and decrypted at the receiver. This way,
any intermediaries, like the servers from a cloud storage, have no access to the data.

### How is this different from other cloud storages?

Most cloud storage providers apply some kind of encryption by default. 
The data is transfered securely, and the file is stored in encrypted form. However, in order to be able to share
the data with other users, the server is able to access your keys or your data.

### How does SecureCloud approach this?

Your files are encrypted using symmetric encryption, an encryption approach which is proved to be both fast and secure.
When you share your files, we apply a relative new approach called Attribute Based Encryption. Based on project roles,
you can grant read and/or write access to other users. The keys required for this are transferred securely, so only
the users you invite really have access.
